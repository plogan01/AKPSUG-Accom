AKPSUG Accommodations


This is a plugin that was designed for PowerSchool by the Alaska PowerSchool Users Group (AKPSUG). The plugin allows a school district the ability to set default assessment types by school, enter student accommodations, and export a Multiple Student Upload (MSU) file that can then be uploaded to DRC. The plugin will also provide a school-level list of student accommodations for building test coordinators.
